# flower-classifier

*Authors: Jeremy Jordan and John Huffman*

John and I were walking through a garden one day and kept pointing out flowers that we thought looked cool. The only problem was... we didn't know the names of any of the flowers! As machine learning engineers, our first thought was "let's build an image classifier" and this project was born.

## Getting started

1. Spin up a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Install [colabcode](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/colabcode).
3. Start the code server.

```
from colabcode import ColabCode
ColabCode(port=10000, mount_drive=True)
```
4. Go to the ngrok link provided.
5. Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremyjordan/flower-classifier.git
```

6. Run `make init` to set up the project.
7. Start a training job by running `train`, optionally providing configuration options.
    - eg. If you want to do a quick check, you can run `train trainer=smoke_test`
